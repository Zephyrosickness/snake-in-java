      TODO: bro this game runs like dookie dogshit

  [[[---POSSIBLE-FEATURES---]]]
    TODO: a button where you can change the speed and the board size (put this on the side when the game is running and put it on the gameover menu too


  [[[---RESOLVED-ISSUES---]]]
    *PROBLEM: you can go insanely fast by going diagonal and/or holding down the arrow keys or pressing keys in the opposite direction
    *SOLUTION: this is an easy fix but its really fun and isnt hurting anyone (you can just choose to not hold down the keys) so it's a feature now

    *PROBLEM: game crashes when changing snake's Y value and positioning appears broken
    *SOLUTION: forgot to update the nextPos var lol so it only updated upon initialization and it would always be 2

    *PROBLEM: unable to lose via hitting game edges (you can lose by hitting urself tho)
    *SOLUTION: all i had to do is calc the row/col vals on the fly by dividing the positional value by the cellCount

    *PROBLEM: the method for making the game end rn feels weird coding-wise
    *SOLUTION:  made new gamemanagar class

    *PROBLEM: snake will lose game even if ur 2 blocks away from border but apparently only if ur direction's RIGHT???
    *SOLUTION: IM A GENIUS OMG!! all i had to do is compare the previous position (instead of the next one) to the current one

    *PROBLEM: vertical checksum is dysfunctional
    *SOLUTION: this is probaly just smth that i need to change the if-statement order for EDIT: yeah kinda

    *PROBLEM: game hangs when hitting top/bottom borders instead of game over
    *SOLUTION: this is cause of the scheduledexecutorservice u just have to do try/catch in the frameadvancement command isntead of putting the horizontal border logic in the bordercheck
