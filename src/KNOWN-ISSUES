  [[[---KNOWN-ISSUES---]]]
    *PROBLEM: unable to lose via hitting game edges (you can lose by hitting urself tho)
    *CAUSE: i havent programmed it yet and i genuinely dont know where to start for that lol (unless i reprogrammed how position values are stored and read to rely off row/col instead of one num for the pos)
    *STATUS: RESOLVED! im a genius. all i had to do is calc the row/col vals on the fly by dividing the positional value by the board size and make a checksum comparing the current row to what the row would be if the position value was modified by one tile in the snake's current direction

    *PROBLEM: game is very laggy
    *CAUSE: it's not very well optimized and there's a lot of methods running every frame cause i had bigger fish to fry for a while
    *STATUS: ??? i didnt change much optimization-wise and it runs fine now. not marking this as resolved since this could be a fringe case

    *PROBLEM: the method for making the game end rn feels weird coding-wise and is weird from a gameplay perspective bc u can still make inputs and its weird and glitchy
    *CAUSE: i cant think of any other solution for it rn so it was the only thing i could think of (unless i close the window but that feels weird
    *STATUS: ??? it's probably the only way i can do this

    *PROBLEM: you can go insanely fast by going diagonal and/or holding down the arrow keys or pressing keys in the opposite direction
    *SOLUTION: this is an easy fix but its really fun and isnt hurting anyone (you can just choose to not hold down the keys) so it's a feature now
    *STATUS: RESOLVED! see above

    *PROBLEM: game crashes when changing snake's Y value and positioning appears broken
    *CAUSE: i have no idea
    *STATUS: RESOLVED! forgot to update the nextPos var lol

  [[[---POSSIBLE-FEATURES---]]]
    add a play again button wheb u lose
    and stats about how long u are
    maybe a high score too where it writes to a txt file your high score every time u lose and then it reads it to set the highscore variable but also that feels like someon can just open it and set it to 999999999999999999 so there would need to be an errchk
